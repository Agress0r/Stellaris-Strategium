 DC_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "The [From.GetSpeciesName] will never be truly free under the reign of [From.GetRulerName]."
 DC_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "The House of Un-[Root.GetAdj] Activities Committee are onto your agents, [From.GetRulerTitle]."
 DC_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "How can you call yourselves a true democracy when the [From.GetAdj] people have voted to elect [From.GetRulerName] as [From.GetRulerTitle], who spits in the face of democratic values?"
 DC_HOSTILE_GREETING_04:0 "If a revolution isn't already underway to topple the hegemony of [From.GetRulerTitle] [From.GetRulerName], it surely will be soon."
 DC_HOSTILE_GREETING_05:0 "One day the [From.GetSpeciesName] will be uncaged and soar the skies of liberty like majestic [From.GetSpeciesNamePluralCompliment], but not while they are pinioned by a [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult] [From.GetRulerTitle]."
 DC_HOSTILE_GREETING_06:0 "Though your kind will never learn the meaning of democracy, we will teach you the meaning of war."
 DC_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "We can have some patience with lesser tyrants, but not much."

 DC_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "A free and open society conducts diplomacy freely and openly."
 DC_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "The rights of the [From.GetSpeciesAdj] people are of paramount importance to us. The authority of the [From.GetAdj] government is a secondary concern."
 DC_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "Your people have a say, [From.GetRulerTitle], but do they have liberty?"
 DC_NEUTRAL_GREETING_04:0 "If you think you know your people's rights better than they do, [From.GetRulerTitle], you know nothing about rights or people."
 DC_NEUTRAL_GREETING_05:0 "Our people find your group mind intriguing and would like to know more about your world view. What is your understanding of advanced social concepts like democracy and liberty?"
 DC_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "Your despotic expansionism has not gone unnoticed. We have been drafting a formal diplomatic complaint, but we are trying to be precise in how we word it."
 DC_THREATENED_GREETING_02:0 "We are different, yes, but we still hope there is a way for both of our empires to coexist peacefully in this galaxy."
 DC_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "The [From.GetAdj] people have done themselves a great favor electing a [From.GetRulerTitle] such as you."
 DC_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "The winds of freedom are sweeping the galaxy. Our people and yours are fortunate to be among the first to enjoy them."
 DC_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "We can see you're not ready to discuss reforms yet, but we appreciate your contribution to regional stability."

 DC_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "You may take our lives, but you will never take our smug sense of moral superiority."

 FP_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "Our reports suggest you have developed translators to understand alien languages. We haven't."
 FP_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "The mind boggles at the rationalizations you must make for the evolution and continued existence of the [From.GetSpeciesAdj] race."
 FP_HOSTILE_GREETING_04:0 "Our scholars have concluded that the purpose of the [From.GetSpeciesName] was to serve as an example of one of the many ways a species can be depraved. Now that we have received the message, we must set about the task to make you an example of what happens to species like yours."
 FP_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "Despite your power, the forces of darkness will not be allowed to prevail. The universe itself will purge you from existence."

 FP_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "Surrender now and all of your [From.GetSpeciesSpawnNamePlural] will be mercifully slaughtered rather than used to study the effects of new weaponry on [From.GetSpeciesAdj] physiology."
 FP_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "You must be destroyed to the last [From.GetSpeciesName]. This is our solemn duty, carried out with joy at the thought of a [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult]-free world."
 FP_WAR_GREETING_04:0 "For each [From.GetSpeciesAdj] life that ends, for each [From.GetSpeciesSpawnName] that perishes before its birth, every star in the galaxy shines a little brighter."
 FP_WAR_GREETING_05:0 "This war will bring about an era of peace, justice, morality, culture, sport, family life, and the obliteration of all other life forms."
