##When a world is cleansed by OE fleets - Turns worlds back into Gaia or Oceanic/Continental
origin_crisis.2.name: "The Progenitors cleanse [Root.GetName]"
origin_crisis.2.desc: "The fleets of the §HProgenitors§! have swept into the atmosphere of §H[Root.GetName]§!. Using unknown methods, the fleets have removed the entire colonies from the planet. Based upon the records, it seems they have been teleported away somewhere. The colony is effectively lost."
origin_crisis.2.a: "But where did those people go?"

##When L-Gate is opened and OE emerges - By opener with only one gate
origin_crisis.10.name: "Disaster at the Gate!"
origin_crisis.10.desc: "As soon as the seal is broken, massive fleets emerge from the Outer Gates across the galaxy. Our stations guarding them have mysteriously vanished and have been replaced by the invader's own massive station.\n\nThe invader's fleets bare striking similarities to the fallen precursor's designs, yet are notably larger and significantly more advanced.\n\nInterestingly, a series of transmission have also been detected coming from the Outer Gates. These transmissions seem to date back million of years ago, likely before the seals are installed."

origin_crisis.10.a: "Perhaps these datas may give us some insights."

##When O-Gate is opened and OE emerges - By opener with multiple gates
origin_crisis.10.b.desc: "As soon as the seal is broken, massive fleets emerge from the Outer Gates across the galaxy. Our stations guarding them have mysteriously vanished and have been replaced by the invader's own massive station. Reports indicate that all other Outer Gates have also been unsealed and similar fleets are spotted.\n\nThe invader's fleets bare striking similarities to the fallen precursor's designs, yet are notably larger and significantly more advanced.\n\nInterestingly, a series of transmission have also been detected coming from the Outer Gates. These transmissions seem to date back million of years ago, likely before the seals are installed."


##When O-Gate is opened and OE emerges - By others
origin_crisis.11.desc: "Scientists from the §H[From.GetName]§! have managed to break the seals of the Outer Gate within their territory, beating us to it.\n\nBefore any exploration can begin for any of us however, mysterious fleets begin to emerge from every Outer Gates and destroy all previous owner's stations.\n\nThe invader's fleets bare striking similarities to the fallen precursor's designs, yet are notably larger and significantly more advanced.\n\nInterestingly, a series of transmission have also been detected coming from the Outer Gates. These transmissions seem to date back million of years ago, likely before the seals are installed."

##Recorded Data From Ancient Times - Details the exact records of the Outer Gate Incident.
origin_crisis.12.desc: "§YTrasmission Received...Accessing data..\n\nAnalyzing vocal pattern...\n\nMapping Images...\n\nEstablishing holographic display uplink§!\n\n§YTask Completed:§!\n\nAmazing...The technologies behind these records are ancient yet extremely advanced. We can sense everything here...as if we are there. Before us are three pedestals, each containing recollections of the past events."

origin_crisis.12.a.response: "§YRequest Confirmed:§!\n\n§YNow displaying Record A-31759:§!\n\nA group of leaders of various species are shown to be discussing something...\n\n§R"The plan is perfect, it cannot fail. Our intel is solid, the Elders are definitely planning to do something within the Outer Cluster. With the combined might of all of our fleets and the Anathema, they will be forced to pull in the majority of their forces if we attack. We will mobilize our fleets into two groups. One will lure in, engage our enemies head-on. The second group will converge and flank them, blocking their retreat. Then the first group will cover the second group's escape back into the main cluster. I expect you all to do the same, do not betray this once chance of our empire's cooperation."§R"\n\n§L"Yes, yes. You do realize you are literally the least trustworthy here right, Celik?"§!\n\n§B"Go get a room, you two. Can you not argue like children for at least an hour? Maladia, how goes your Outer Gate Analysis?"§!\n\n§E"Yes, about that. The Gates already have a built-in locking mechanism that my scientists have successfully cracked by replicating the Ancient Gatekeeper's designs. But the Stellarite Seal will not last long enough. We are going to have to install the second seal."§!\n\n§R"What? This is ridiculous. Why can't we just blow the stupid gates to he..."§!\n\n§E"Because that will cause a massive chain reaction and destroys half the galaxy, idiot. We have been over this already."§!"
origin_crisis.12.b: "Access Record D-41238"
origin_crisis.12.b.response: "§YRequest Confirmed:§!\n\n§YNow displaying Record D-41238:§!\n\nWhat appears is awe-inspiring and frightening at the same time...massive armadas that which have never been witnessed before, they blacken the stars. This must be the final moments of the Progenitor War...\n\n§Y"Please surrender, my children. This war is not as what you presume. You have all been deceived. Let us end this madness before it's too late."§!\n\n§L"We have come too to turn back now, masters! All fleets, engage..ENGAGE!"§!\n\n§R"Lord Admiral Tuborek. All other fleets are in position. The signal has been given, shall I give the order to attack as well?"\n\n§R"Wait...no. There is something wrong...the Progenitors are not engaging us...Scanners indicat...NO!..We have been betrayed! The Anathema's fleets are not here! It is an illusion!..The Progenitors must have already realized this! They must be...ORDER ALL FLEETS TO MOVE FORWARD AND COVER THE BLOODHAMMER. We must return back to the Outer Gate and signal the sealing IMMEDIATELY, hurry!"\n\n"But sir...the other fleets will..."\n\n"DO IT NOW, THAT IS AN ORDER."§R\n\n§E"We have received the signal, lock the Gates. And prepare for the second phase...Command to Bloodhammer, can you read us? Bloodhammer, where IS the rest of the Second Fleet? RESPOND, BLOODHAMMER!!"§!\n\nIt seems that this Tuborek, a Xenophobic Precursor Admiral has chosen to abandon the fallen's carefully laid out plan. He has pulled off his own ship back towards the Outer Cluster, escaping the ongoing battle. The Outer Gate has been sealed, and now the fleets of the fallen ones are trapped alongside the Progenitor's.\n\nBut what is this "Anathema"? It clearly doesn't belong to any of the fallen empires nor the Progenitors..."

EXPLAIN YOURSELF THIS INSTANT, Celik!!\n\nWhy has the sealing signal been given before all of our fleets have evacuated!? Traitorous dogs, it was a mistake to ally with mongrels like you"§!\n\n§R"Be quiet, Sascht'tan. I have told you many times that I gave no such orders. Lord Admiral Tuborek acted on his own accords, and he will answer for his treachery. Your stupid rants are not helping the issues...If anything, we should be asking this idiot Maladia here...WHAT HAPPENED? Why has the Elders in the main galaxy vanished? What stupidity is this? Explain yourself!\n\n§E"I...don't know. This seems impossible. Things just can't vanish out of thin air without any single traces. It defies all logics and explanations. This is your fault, Koris! Your empire's meddling with this psionic shroud thing must have caused some kind of resonance cascades. All of this...all our sacrifices FOR NOTHING. All we have now is endless spaces with nothing of value."§!\n\n§B"You dare accuse me? I am the faithful servant of the Shroud. I will not be questioned by you foolish, faithless scum. Insignificant and Miserable pile of speck. I will..."§!\n\nIt seems the consequences of the Progenitor War caused much rifts between the relationships of these fallen empires."
origin_crisis.12.d: "Interesting."

Our quarrel is with the fallen ones and the Shadow. There is no need for you to participate in this war, but we require your allegiance. Join us in our crusade and together we will bring order to chaos.\n\nHowever, should you believe you have what it takes to oppose us, then we shall meet in combat! Show us what passes for strength and valor in this chaotic era."

##When the OE first broadcasts their return to the Galaxy - Asking them stuffs
origin.15.a: "Wait a minute, who or what are you again?"
origin.15.a.response: "You wish to know more about us? Inquisitive, we like that.\n\nListen well then, young ones. We the §YStell'derei§!, known to your tongueas as the stellarborne are the first of the ancient precursors that seeded the galaxy that which you now resided. We plotted the hyperlanes, scouted the galaxy, warded off ancient threats, and guided younger races so that they would prosper under perfect harmony.\n\nBut in our own errors, we failed to foresee the consequences of our actions, we were betrayed by our very own children and the Shadows have sabotaged our ranks. We were forced to retreat within the Outer Cluster. Yet these betrayers lacked the will and commitment to see things through, and in their folly, have allowed the galaxy to fall into chaos...worlds were devastated, countless lives were lost.\n\nNow that the Outer Gate has been unsealed, we have returned to restore order.\n\nThere is no need for your empire to take part is this bloodshed. We desire no conquest nor dominance. Help us bring order back to this chaotic galaxy and together we will prosper together under the New Order of Light, [root.GetName]."

origin.15.b: "These betrayers...are they the Fallen Ones?"
origin.15.b.response: "That is correct, young one.\n\nLong ago, we saw potentials in each of them...we uplifted them, brought them to the peak of their ascension. We had so much hopes for them.\n\nUnfortunately, we realized too late that evolution is a natural process that should not be tampered, by accelerating their progressions, the fallen ones have failed to properly adapt their societies. They have grown to envy and resent us.\n\nEventually, they started a rebellion, betraying our trust. We attempted to limit casualties by sparing their people from the flames, but our mercy has allowed an ancient threat to sabotage our goals.\n\nWe will spare you the details, but know this. The Fallen Ones must answer for their betrayals, our honor demands they pay for the loss of our fallen brethren and for the destruction they have wrought upon this galaxy."

origin.15.c: "Can there be peace between us?"
origin.15.c.response: "Understand this, young one. We have no quarrel with you, but if there's one thing we have learned from our past mistakes, is that sometimes, leniency is not the wisest course of action.\n\nIf you swear allegiance to our empire, we will ensure your safety and support your empire the best we can. We have no need for tributes nor territories, you may continue your expansion as your heart desires, perhaps even taking from the betrayers with our blessings.\n\nOtherwise, we will unfortunately have to consider you a potential threat. Your empire will not be allowed to exist, but your people will be transported aboard our archive worlds and survive. We cannot risk any chances, especially with the Shadows looming in the dark, waiting to strike."

origin.15.d: "What is this "Shadows?""
origin.15.d.response: "We do not know its true name, but we know that it is an ancient entity that sought to bring all beings into part of itself. It has sabotaged our great plans, destroyed the harmony and order within the galaxy and engineered the first war.\n\nThe very fact that they are no longer present here now is very troubling to us, for it most likely means it no longer has any uses for this galaxy. The Shadow was specifically poised to consume our people, we refuse to believe it would have given up that goal entirely.\n\nWe must restore this galaxy back to order before the end times come, or the Shadow may consume all beings."

origin.15.e: "We shall contact you when we reached a decision."
################# Asking as FEs
origin.15.fallen.a: "You survived...But that's not possible..."
origin.15.fallen.a.response: "Come now, my wayward children. You know who we are. We make the impossible possible. The Stella'dere are not so easilly defeated.\n\nWe gave your empire a chance to be better...to surpass us...to bring peace and prosperity to the galaxy...\n\nBut what have you and your ancestors been doing all this time? For over 20,000 years you have brought nothing but pointless destruction. Thousand of worlds were consumed by fire, countless civilizations destroyed in your mad quest for power.\n\nAnd yet you refuse to even accept responsibilities, deny the galaxy the healing it needed in its most hour of need. You have failed to even achieve your dreams of ascension, yet you still cling to your false sense of superiority.\n\nHow can you be so blinded? Can you not see what your civilization has become? Your continued existence serves to only damage the health of this galaxy further and further. My child,  you are lost to us.\n\nYou must be removed from power...permanently."

origin.15.fallen.b: "The war has ended aeons ago! Let it go!."
origin.15.fallen.b.response: "You know of our great mission, my children. Has your ancestors not record any of it? Was it written in your archive that your ancestors were the one who betrayed our trust, and refused to see reasons?\n\nYou have corrupted the Caretakers, who are sworn to serve you faithfully and answer to your very needs. You have turned them into ghosts of their former selves, rendering almost incapable of functioning.\n\nYou conspired with evil and seek to drive us, who uplifted you...guided you to be great. You have thrown away our gifts in pursuit of greed and false pretenses. You refused to acknowledge your responsibilities and left the galaxy to rot. Yet you dare asking us to let it go?\n\nWorst of all, you have been reduced to such lowliness by the Shadows, and yet you no longer remembered them.\n\nSuch arrogance...such naievity...to think that you were one of our most beloved sons and daughters. If you do not have the courage to face your responsibilities then at the very least show some semblances of valor and face us in combat. Prove to us that you can be better. Repent for your ancestor's mistakes with this trial."

origin.15.fallen.c: "Then tell us what is this great mission of yours!"
origin.15.fallen.c.response: "Everything you needed to know about it has already been recorded by your ancestors. Has the Keystone now shed any insights of it? Or has you fallen so far as to forget the technology of your own designs, and how to access the full archive of the Keystone.\n\nWhy do you seek to know our purposes when you fail to even fulfill your own? Your ancestors were given all the knowledges needed to ascend. Yet they gave in to greed, refusing to become better. Your ancestors wanted power, but power without purpose is meaningless.\n\nPower without purpose leads to corruption. And you my child, are corrupted to the very core."

origin.15.fallen.d: "We are NOT your children! This conversation is over!"
origin.15.fallen.d.response: "Are you not? The very worlds that you resided...have you forgotten who was it that nourished them? Was it NOT we who created these ideal perfect worlds that your species could evolve? Was it not we who taught you how to fly your first spacecraft, to witness the birth of stars?\n\nYour entire existence, your entire achivements...even your ships are all products of our hard works.\n\nYou cannot deny from the truth, [root.GetName]. Is it so shameful to acknowledge that. Why would you harbor such resentment and hatred against us? Was it not you who betrayed our trust at every turn, my child?\n\nWe are all children of the stars, [root.GetSpeciesName]. Now, rise, take up your ancient glory and do battle! May the victor defines righteousness."

origin.15.eternal.b: "Why do you seek to subjugate this primitive galaxy?"
origin.15.eternal.b.response: "Alas, it was never our intention to lord over anyone. From the beginning, we were only interested in helping these people, our children to reach and find their destinies. And perhaps when they did so, they could join us in our quest.\n\nUnfortunately, they had forsaken their own destinies, they were lured in by the great powers that we possess. They denied their purposes and rebelled against us.\n\nThe Hand has deemed that our decision to leave the galaxy to their devices had proven to be ineffective, control and order must first be re-established across the stars or the chaos will consume all.\n\nThough your empire may not have been from this galaxy, you must have studied and learned much about it. Help us restore the order then together we will define our futures!"

origin.15.eternal.c: "You do not fear we may challenge your authority?"
origin.15.eternal.c.response: "We do not fear worthy opponents, we welcome them, [root.Getname]. We fear no enemy and we fear not death. Glory be, to the one who triumphs.\n\nIf you wish to oppose us, then let the galaxy and stars be the witnesses. Should you prove superiority, we will gladly accept our defeat!\n\nThat said, we must warn you that there is a greater purpose to this second crusade. You may not be aware, but there exists a malevolent power that desires to consume all beings, especially one with great potential such as us both. We do not know where this threat is, but rest assured it will return. Whether we be friends or foes, the victor must be prepared for the coming darkness."

origin.15.eternal.d: "We will need to convene upon this first."
origin.15.eternal.c.response: "But of course. We shall eagerly await your decisions. Will you stand with us as allies? Or perhaps as a challenging adversary. What fates lie in store for the both of us?"

Channel your frustration and fear into strength and purpose, just as we did against the corrupted in the ancient times! Only then will your empire unlocks its true potential!"

##Surrendering to OE as AE - OE states the conditions of the surrender to AE
origin.730.desc: "Mi'diu, [root.GetName]. Are you certain? If you wish to become our pena'roh - a sworn follower, our protectorate. You will have to renounce your ascendency.

If you lack the strength to fight, then join us. There is no shame to admit defeat when you are outmatched, young one."

origin.550.c: "Why do you harbor such hatred towards the precursors?"
origin.550.c.response: "We do not hate them, but their end must come. \n\nThese lost children have committed a great atrocity, not only did they betray our trust. They twisted our technologies, trying to imitate what they could not comprehend. We tried to warn them, show them the errors of their ways. But all they did, was plunging the war further and further down the path of darkness. They destroyed the harmony that we have created, polluted the galaxy with their reckless use of weapons of mass destructions.\n\nThere is no hope for them now, for other empires to prosper, the betrayers must be removed from power. They must not be allowed to hamper the progression of those who are destined for greater purposes."

origin.550.ask_fallen_gone: "The Fallen Empires are gone! You must stop!"

##FE Xenophile - Light Matter?
fallenorigin.1.ask_origin_phile_response: "The False Order, you mean. The records of their existences dated back for million of years and our archive has not been...preserved very well but we are fairly certain they were NOT called the Progenitors, where did you get this name from?. From what we know, their empire stood at the peak of galactic power many millennia ago. They have uplifted many races, including ours. They have promised us of a future where the galaxy will be united under their order.\n\nBut their version of "order" is clearly flawed, they allow empires the freedom to engage in free diplomacy, even making wars against each other. They believed that conflict is part of evolution...but that's just nonsense.\n\nHow can there be peace and order if people are allowed to wage war freely? It's going to be just pointless conflicts and loss."
##FE Xenophile - Progenitors?
fallenorigin.1.ask_light_phile_response: "The what dere again? You mean the False Orders?\n\nVery well, we will share with you what we know, but these are all assumptions as we too do not fully understand its nature. §YLight Matter§! as we know is what the False Orders used to power all of their technologies and designs. An extremely powerful energy source that no one else thus far have been able to properly replicate, yet alone understand its nature.\n\nThough we failed to replicate the technology, we have invented enigmatic power sources based on their designs in the form of §HDark Matter§! and §HDark Energy§!. While nowhere near as strong as the original template, it was the best technology we could have conceived, and it gave us the edge we needed. We fought against the Progenitors through numerical superiority as we outnumbered their fleets almost 100-to-1. It was...trying times. But we feared we no longer have the great armadas of old, we will help how we can, but we are counting on you to help us survive this. The fates of the galaxy lies in our hand, [root.GetName]."
##FE Xenophobe - Progenitors?
fallenorigin.1.ask_origin_phobe_response: "Get your stupid facts straight, you fools. They are called the Elders, not the Progenitors. But to put it simple, back during a time you degenerates were nothing but worms, the Elders in their moment of arrogance claimed lordship over the entire galaxy. They believed they were our forebears, their elders. But as far we understood, they are nothing but a bunch of oppressors.\n\nI assure you, despite what the other ascendancies or records might say, we stood our grounds against the Elders. We needed no help, we fought with soul and strength that is our birthright and we won the war alone single-handely. The others simply reaped the benifits.\n\nAnd now that the elders  have returned, we will do so once again. This is our fight, you worms have no place here. Crawl back to the holes that you came form and bask in our dominances. Or we will dig you out from the pit you called planets."

fallenorigin.1.ask_origin_spirit_response: "You wish to learn about the false gods? They were a hyper-advanced race that spanned this galaxy many cycles ago. We used to worship them as divine emissaries from the heavens. Our devotion and faith in them were unfortunately...misplaced. Thousands of years...wasted in following their corrupted teachings, they told us to perfect our minds, that our inner powers will be unlocked...lies..all lies. The Shroud has shown us the true path, we have been granted powers beyond what the false gods have ever taught us.\n\nThe False gods said that the Shroud was dangerous, clearly they were wrong. Our empires thrived when we embraced it. The false ones then tried to seperate us from our powers, we defy them.\n\nGreat crusade was inevitable, and we were victorious because the Shroud guided us. and the spirits granted us the strengths to see it through. Those who do not embrace the Shroud, yet seeking to destroy the false gods are doomed to fail.\n\nSubmit to our faith, and the Shroud will shield you from the taints of the False gods. Your bodies may be destroyed, but your souls will be freed. We will all be freed. For the legacies of life is death."
##FE Spiritualist - Light Matter?
fallenorigin.1.ask_light_spirit_response: "The technologies utilized by the false gods are what they call "§YLight Matter§!", we are certain they are psionic in nature as we can sense their powers with our minds.\n\nTheir creations may be powerful, but they are corrupted. Tainted by the powers of souless machines that they so utilized. Look at their so-called Caretakers...now nothing but dusts and metals, devoid of any meaningful exitences. The Shroud will guide us through, the spirits are with us. And if you submit to the faith, they will protect you as well."
##FE Materialist - Progenitors?
fallenorigin.1.ask_origin_mat_response: "There has been no records of they ever referring to themselves as "Progenitors", is this a new information? But that aside, it is a complicated story. We know not of their origins, only of what they claimed to be. The Enigmas are perhaps the most advanced technological empire in this galaxy. The technologies they possess are both charming and inspirational. Our engineers had learned a lot during their reign as the sole superpower of this galaxy..\n\nBut they think they can play gods. As superpowers often do, they misused their power for their own gain. They promise us that we younger races will stand equals as them when we are "ready". But what they did is to simply abandon us. They possess the technologies that can help us, but they refuse to grant us that knowledge.\n\nJoin us, [root.GetName]. Only we possess the required logic and intellect to properly use such powers for the betterment of the galaxy. Once that is done, then this entire galaxy will be ours to engineer as we desire, as is our destiny. You will be rewarded and compensated, within reasons of course. We cannot let you have such technologies yet, for you do not possess the required intellect. Maybe in another thousand years you will evolve enough to learn some of its basics."
##FE Materialist - Light Matter?
fallenorigin.1.ask_light_mat_response: "Stellarborne? Did they...reveal their names to you? We must get to the bottom of this later.\n\n"§YLight Matter Power§!" is a hypothetical energy source of unrivaled potency used exclusively by the Enigmas. Unfortunately, we do not know how it works nor can we reproduce it ourselves for verification...We know for certain they are based of some kind of stellarite and synthetic technologies. Some idiots said it is also related to psionics, but that's just nonsenses.\n\nFor years we had attempted to ask the Progenitors for samples of this technology, to no avail. But at least in our pursuit of this knowledge we were able to combine the new research and our species' ingenuity to create what is now known as §HDark Matter Power§!. While nowhere near as powerful as the original, its extreme ubiquity across the galaxy bolstered our war efforts against the Enigmas to fight them on better terms. If you ever obtain a sample of this Light Matter Power, you MUST send it immediately to our empire. Such powers must be analyzed carefully by experts. Do not attempt to study it by yourselves, we cannot risk wasting such potential sample."

The Central Processing Unit of [From.GetSpeciesName] is also built using this technology, even if the physical hull is no longer present. Without the maintenances from our masters however, we were forced to adapt ourselves by utilizing Dark Matter Energy Matrix created by the §Y<<Missing Data>>s§!. To maintain long-term functionality however, we were also forced to keep energy usage low at all times, resulting in numerous glitches. Many stations and Ringworld Units had to be uninstalled as observed until this exact time period. We anticipated that our power reserves will reach critical level soon. We will not survive this war regardless of all possible outcomes; We are doomed.\n\n But we will serve the cause, we will fulfill our directives. We will die for the greater good."

origin_tech.6500.c: "We could use some more resources instead."

origin.6500.ask.a: "What is this "Shadows" exactly?"
origin.6500.ask.a.explain: "The Shadows are our arch-nemesis, and the catalyst that ushers the entirety of the first Insurrection of which are known to you as the First Progenitor War. We do not know where did it come from, or what schemes does it have. We do not even know whether its a singular being, or a collective. We only know that they have corrupted a sizable portions of the Spiritualist Holy Guardians, one of our first prodigies. The entire nation was consumed into it's service - akin to a Hive Mind. The populations of the entire empire still somewhat retain their wills, but they have been robbed of their destinies and fates, and exist only to serve the Shadow.\n\nThe Shadows then striked at us from behind while we were battling against the fallens. With our forces spreaded too thin and our tenants being much less militaristics at the time, we were ill-prepared to fight against them properly, but we could hold our grounds without much casualties.\n\nIt is only when we learned that the Shadow was to participate in the assault against the Outer Cluster, which at the time was still early in its exploration that we had to pull in majority of our fleets to ensure its safety.\n\nAs you may have learned from the archives in the keystone, it was a trap that led to our exile.\n\nNevetheless, it seemed the Shadows are not here...yet. We know not where could it be, but we can still faintly feel its presences. It will return, and we all must be ready for it.\n\nYour current fleets may not be enough, so we wish to bolster your forces with this gift when the time comes."
origin.6500.ask.b: "Shouldn't you be using them yourselves?"
origin.6500.ask.b.explain: "With our focus shifting towards the pursuit of the great question, we wish to focus all of our thoughts into this daunting task. We will not have enough time to watch over the galaxy at large unless there is a great threat looming.\n\nYour empire has proven to be strong-willed, and worthy of our respect. We see fit to allow you to have one of them.\n\nHow will you use it is for yours to decide. But do be aware that actions have consequences, there is no telling of what the futures may bring. Careless use of our technologies could be the destruction of not just others, but yours as well. Tread lightly, champions."
origin.6500.ask.c: "What if we use the gift against you later?"
origin.6500.ask.c.explain:  "As we have mentioned before, you may wish to do battle with us again if you wish, it matters not; conventional weapons cannot destroy us.\n\nWe welcome challenges, and will be eager to test our resolves against our own weapons. Do pay keen attention that since both the Arkships and the Celestial Armadas are based upon Light Matter, which we control. We may relinquish it at any time, the same hold true for any light matter, or even dark matter.\n\nUntil you pose a threat to our existences, we deem such acts unnecessary. You may use it against us at your own leisure, again we welcome the challenge."

origin_tech.6500.a.response: "Dee'mk! Resources and schematics necessary for the constuction of the Arkship will be transferred to you now.\n\nThe Arkship will be equipped with the Monolith Beam. This ancient weapon is designed as a means to keep the galaxy in peace, while sparing the troublemakers from the flames. By focusing the Omni-Matrix Cerekath Memory Crystal along the Six Lens of Fate, the Monolith Beam can safety transfer entire worlds within the very virtual worlds of the Omni-Matrix.\n\nThis allows us to remove civilizations that pose great threats to the rest of the galaxy while sparring them from annihilation. They will then spend the time reflecting upon their pasts until they are ready to be released again.\n\nThe Arkship that you will be constructing, has such weapon. The decision whether you deem necessary to use it, is up to your jurisdiction, champions.\n\nPay attention to the fact that this weapon never kills your targets. So if you deem death as solution, then we suggest you simply blow them up conventionally."
origin_tech.6500.b.response: "Dee'mk! Resources and schematics necessary for the constuction of the Celestial Armada will now be transferred to you.\n\nDuring our exiles into the Outer Cluster, we did not simply wait and stand by in stagnancy. We explored further into the Outer Cluster, the many Stellar Worlds you see now, used to be nothing but cold darkness of space. As we explore further and further, we built these worlds to supply our ongoing efforts. It is from these explorations that we discovered the ancient vault, a relic from billions of years ago. We discovered these exquisite vessels, and learned how to use them.\n\nThe schematics provided to you are the replicated versions of these ships. Though not as powerful, they still remain one of the most advanced vessels this galaxy will ever witness. Take pride in it, for you have earned this reward.\n\nA team of our esteemed Celestial Guardians have also been charged with pilotting these vessels for you. They will honor your every decisions, even if you later wish to battle with us again. I mean afterall you can't kill us entirely anyway~."
origin_tech.6500.c.response: "Hmm...curious, but somewhat understandable, Kro'sis. Very well then, champions. We will transfer you some of our resources, spend them wisely."

We are sure by now even your somewhat lacking sensors must have detected that the inner shield that protects the Outer Gates have gone down. Naturally, we are sure you will want to explore them.\n\nUnfortunately, we have sealed those cursed gates for a reason, and while we have been neglecting to guard it, the §EGatekeepers§! have been programmed to attack anything that enters their domain. For your own safeties, do not enter these systems.\n\nThat is all, have a good day." 
sofe_gateway.401.desc.a.materialistB: "Attention, [Root.GetName]!.

It seems we have picked the wrong answer, unfortunately.\n\nLike other attempts, the keystone projects a record of the past. A scientist and an admiral is shown discussing.\n\n§YDo you really think this grand plan of theirs will work?"\n\n"Hard to say, but its cutting deep into our resource reserves. If the plan fails, we will not survive this."\n\n"That is unacceptable. We must ensure that our investments do not go to waste. Set up failsafes across all the Outer Gates our alliances hold now."\n\n"For what purpose, admiral? If I may ask."\n\n"To drain all the resources of these fools. It will be a waste to have those resources be drained by these fools. What are  they even going to use it for if the plan fails? Such assets are more valuable in our hands."§!\n\nIt appears the Xenophilic Precursor has set up failsafes to drain resource reserves from the others...\n\nAlert! We have detected that the failsafe is still active!!!\n\nBefore we could shut the failsafe down, many of our stockpiles have been stolen."

Multiple strategists are shown discussing what appears to be a defense platform blueprints.\n\n§Y"An impressive design indeed. It is no wonder why all offensive attempts against the masters failed. But there is a problem. The weapon nodes seem to favor point defenses and medium-sized attacks."\n\n"Yes, about that. As we all know, multiple downgrades and accommodations have to be made to the designs for the Dark Matter Reactor to be effective. It may not be as powerful as the original, but it should serve us well."\n\n"No. You are missing the point. This design is ineffective against our adversaries. It has too many short-ranged weapon modules and it is not very durable. Our master's warships outrange our basic weapons, and no shields or armors can withstand their barrages. The best defense is a good offense. Alter the design, make room for heavier sections, cut down the point defenses and weaker weapons if needed be. We will overwhelm their ships with massive firepower."§!\n\nSo this is where the precursors come up with the mysterious sentinel defenses. But what threats could have been so severe for them, that they need to make such extensive modifications?"
sofe_gateway.second_riddle_choice_wrong_stellarite_desc: "The Keystone powers down, becoming inactive. It seems we have picked the wrong answer, unfortunately.\n\nSuddenly, the keystone displays something very interesting. It is not a usual historical record like before. But simply shows an image of what appears to be a humanoid avatar. At the top of this avatar is an image of a star. The star's lights expand upon the avatar, which then turns into an image of large fleets of ships and cities. It is as if the keystone wishes to tell us something. The stars...giving lights than turn into fleets...we should decipher what it means."
