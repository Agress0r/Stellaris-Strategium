tech_stellarite_gunship_desc: "In the past, our carriers have severe weaknesses against enemy fleet formations with powerful point defense systems, or simply superior long-range firepowers. The latter usually results in most of our carriers being destroyed before their bombers can even perform their first run. Our scientists are looking for a new approach to create a long-range gunship instead."

tech_stellarite_hyper_jump_drive: "Sigma-Class Hyperdrive Amplifier"
tech_stellarite_hyper_jump_drive_desc: "Even with the new-generation, state-of-the-art jump drive, sometimes that alone is not enough. We can improve upon our current hyperdrive amplifier to create an improved design with less drawbacks."

tech_stellarite_inspire_aura: "Stellar Forge Network"
tech_stellarite_inspire_aura_desc: "One benifits of stellarite energy is that they each radiate enough residues that a strong network can be formed between the entire fleet by supplement each ship with these residues through a specialized forge. Perhaps one could be installed aboard our capital ships?"

tech_stellarite_jump_drive: "Stellar Warp Drive"
tech_stellarite_jump_drive_desc: "Even more impressive than before, the new generation FTL-drive can perform a warp jump even greater than before, and the system FTL charge-up sequence is almost eliminated."

tech_stellarite_laser: "Sigma Laser"
tech_stellarite_laser_desc: "Our first attempt to harness stellarite energy as a beam-weapon, Sigma Laser turns the enemies into ashes using the power of the stars."

tech_stellarite_missile: "Starviper Missile Launchers"
tech_stellarite_missile_desc: "In the past, we classify various types or guided ordinances based on their sizes and yields, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Not anymore, it is time we utilize our advanced technology to truly create a powerful explosive warhead. A missile to surpass torpedoes."

tech_stellarite_photon: "Stellarite Plasma Cannon"
tech_stellarite_photon_desc: "Stellarite Energy can be transformed into a powerful plasma-like energy weapon that is deadlier than any previous Dark Matter-based plasma weaponry."

tech_stellarite_plasma_cannon: "Supercharged Stellarite Energy Cannon"
tech_stellarite_plasma_cannon_desc: "By supercharging stellarite energy, the weapon is able to fire an extremely deadly energy projectile over a long distance. The massive amplifers of this cannon requires a lot of power, however."

tech_stellarite_point_defence: "Sigma Point Defense System"
tech_stellarite_point_defence_desc: "Increasingly powerful missiles and strikecrafts called for different approaches to our countermeasures. Our energy-based point defenses are now readjusted for powerful, slow-firing long-range defense barriers that can contribute more to the fight itself."

tech_stellarite_reactive_drone: "Solar-Forged Drone Platings"
tech_stellarite_reactive_drone_desc: "More sophisticated and durable than the Alpha-Generation drones, the Sigma-Class Drones should provide better protection, deterrances and maintenances to the ship's armors."

tech_stellarite_reactor: "Stellarite Energy Mastery"
tech_stellarite_reactor_desc: "With our current dark matter technology, it is now possible to create powerful equipments and tools to study stellarites properly. Although the true nature behind the specifics of Stellarite Power are still up for debate, none will argue that if this power has a potential to surpass Dark Matter."

tech_stellarite_reactor_booster: "Stellarite Auxilary Power Amplifier"
tech_stellarite_reactor_booster_desc: "Much like the Dark Energy variants, the Stellarite APA not only provides additional backup powers, but also reduces the cost of the ship itself."

tech_stellarite_sensors: "Stellar Arrays"
tech_stellarite_sensors_desc: "This new generation of survelliance systems determine ship movements by analzying the shifting patterns and reactions of the system's celestial bodies."

tech_stellarite_shield: "Stellarite Shield"
tech_stellarite_shield_desc: "Due to the fact that Stellarite Energy significantly outperforms the old Dark Matter and Dark Energy variants, it is only natural that Stellarite-powered energy shields are superior to their old cousions as well. The barriers are almost twice as strong as the previous generation."

tech_stellarite_shield_supercharger: "Stellarite Supercharged Barrier"
tech_stellarite_shield_supercharger_desc: "Superchaging barriers grant the ship's shield generators extremely increased potency even greater than Dark Energy variants."

tech_stellarite_star_charter: "Stellarite Star Charter"
tech_stellarite_star_charter_desc: "State-of-the-art Survillance System on-board this auxilary chamber allows the ship to function as a mobile sentry array that is impervious to all ambush attempts."

tech_stellarite_thruster: "Stellarite Thrusters"
tech_stellarite_thruster_desc: "Since stars are everywhere and thrusters are designed for subspace travelling, it is natural that we simply develop thrusters that draw power of the stars themselves and bind them to our will."

tech_stellarite_titan_beam: "Light of Destruction"
tech_stellarite_titan_beam_desc: "Not too dissimilar from the energy weapon utilized by Stellarite Devouver, Light of Destruction fires a deadly beam of Stellarite Energy. The much more refined reactors, amplifiers and energy lens make the weapon much superior to the one utilized by the beast, thanks to our superior technological designs."

tech_stellarite_weapon_core: "Super-focused Stellarite Core"
tech_stellarite_weapon_core_desc: "Super-focused Stellarite Core converts excess energies from surrounding materials to amplify the ship's weapon systems for greater performance."

tech_warp_stellarite_cannon: "Weaponized Warping Technology"
tech_warp_stellarite_cannon_desc: "There is only so much pure kinetic force can do as ship protections and defenses keep getting stronger and energy weapons quickly dominating the fields, our scientists seek better ways to improve our current mass accelerators. While the concept sounds weird and quite dumb, it may be possible to instead turn the entire cannon into a powerful warphole generator that can tear a fabric of space and sends the warhead inside enemy ship, bypassing shields and travelling distance completely. The only issue as of now, is how to do that while still maintaining the speed and velocity of the projectile?"

tech_computer_stellarite: "Stellar-Class Combat Analyzer"
tech_computer_stellarite_desc: "The Stellar-Class Combat Analyzer is an extremely advanced combat computer that analyze the battlefield conditions in real-time and predicts the best course of actions and then automatically instruct the ship's entire systems to react accordingly with minimal manual input required."
